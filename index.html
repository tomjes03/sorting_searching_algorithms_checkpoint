<!-- The process you're describing is known as insertion sort.
It involves iterating through an array and inserting each element into its correct position within the sorted subarray that precedes it. 
Here's an example of how insertion sort works: -->

def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]  # element to be inserted
        j = i - 1  # index of the last element in the sorted subarray

        # Shift elements greater than key to the right
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1

        # Insert the key in its correct position
        arr[j + 1] = key

    return arr

    Let's say we have an array arr = [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]. Here's how the insertion sort algorithm would process it step by step:

Initial array: [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]
First iteration: The key is 2. Since 2 is smaller than 5, we shift 5 to the right and insert 2 at index 0. Array: [2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 3]
Second iteration: The key is 4. 4 is larger than 2 but smaller than 5, so we insert it at index 1. Array: [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]
Third iteration: The key is 6. Since 6 is greater than all previous elements, it remains at index 3. Array: [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]
Fourth iteration: The key is 1. We shift 6, 5, 4, and 2 to the right and insert 1 at index 0. Array: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3]
Fifth iteration: The key is 3. We shift 6 and 5 to the right and insert 3 at index 2. Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

<!-- After the final iteration, the array is sorted in ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
This is the result of applying insertion sort to the original array. -->
